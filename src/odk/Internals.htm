<H1>Internals</H1>

<P>This page discusses how the ODK is put together.</P>

<H2>GGS and /os</H2>

<P>GGS is divided into two parts: GGS (which is a chat server) and
/os (which controls everything related to Othello). The ODK turns messages from
these servers into message objects (subclasses of CMsg); to handle any message simply
edit the code in OsMsgHandlers.cpp or GGSMsgHandlers.cpp. The code is designed so that
you will not have to modify GGS and Os files other than the MsgHandlers files.</P>

<H2>OsObjects</H2>

<P>Many of the OsObjects 'work' - boards, positions, clocks, and games know how
to update themselves, for instance.</P>

<H2>Responding to messages</H2>

<P>To respond to messages you need to put text to *pggsstream, a subclass of iostream.
You must flush the stream(pggsstream->flush()) before the message is sent to GGS.
The file recv.txt is a log of
all communication between your computer and GGS and can help you track down errors.</P>
<P>The ODK should handle reading from the stream and turning the input into messages.</P>
<P>The input stream fails if the connection
closes or there is an error on the connection. When the stream fails ggsstream::Process() will
return; if you are using the standard code from main.cpp the program terminates
after ggsstream::Process() returns. The standard way to close the connection and end the
program is to call pggsstream->Logout().</P>
