<P><strong>ggsstream::HandleOsRequestDelta(const 
<A HREF="CMsgOsRequestDelta.htm">CMsgOsRequestDelta</A>* pmsg)</strong></P>
<P>This function is called both
when a new challenge is issued and when an old challenge is cancelled. Challenges are
normally directed at a specific player but can also be generic.</P>
<P>Challenges are cancelled if the are accepted, declined, or one of the players leaves GGS.</P>

<H2>Normal Response</H2>

<P>Override this function in CODKStream:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Update the challenges list by calling BaseOsRequestDelta()</LI>
<LI> If it is a new
challenge directed at the bot, the bot should either accept ( << "ts accept " << idr )
or decline ( << "ts decline " << idr ). If it declines it should give a reason.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This is designed to be easy; see the commented-out sample code in ODKStream.cpp.
CMsgOsRequest has a number of RequireXXX() functions to help you.
If the request is of the proper type they will return true otherwise they return false and
send a reason back to the challenger.</P>

<H2>Sample Code</H2>

<PRE>
void CODKStream::HandleOsRequestDelta(const CMsgOsRequestDelta* pmsg) {
	BaseOsRequestDelta(pmsg);

	if (pmsg->fPlus && pmsg->IAmChallenged()) {
		if (pmsg->RequireBoardSize(8) && pmsg->RequireKomi(false) && pmsg->RequireAnti(false))
			(*this) << "t /os accept " << pmsg->idr << "\n";
		else
			(*this) << "t /os decline " << pmsg->idr << "\n";

		flush();
	}
}
</PRE>
<P>This rejects requests for anti games (player with the most discs loses),
komi games (where the players must guess the outcome of the game) and any game not
played on an 8x8 board.</P>
