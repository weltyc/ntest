<H1>COsMoveListItem</H1>

<P>A COsMoveListItem contains all information about a move in a game. A vector of them
is stored in a game as a COsMoveList.</P>

<H2>Notes</H2>

<P>When you are creating a mli (for returning from the GetMove() function) you must fill
in the mv member.</P>
<P>If you have requested trust mode, you must fill in the tElapsed member;
if not, GGS will fill it in for you.</P>
<P>If you are in a komi game and are making the initial move, you must fill in the dEval member.
Otherwise it is optional, but it is recommended as it will help you debug your program.</P>
<P>When you receive a COsMoveListItem from GGS it will have a move and an elapsed time; dEval will
be 0 if none was sent with the move.</P>
